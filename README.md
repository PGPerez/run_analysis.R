## Course Project - Getting and Cleaning Data
##
## These are the steps I used to complete this project:
## Read Data into R
##
## add feature label names to each data set (i.e. Testdata and Traindata)
##
## add "Subject_id" label to SubjectTest and SubjecTrain
##
##
## add "Activity_id" label to Testlabels and Trainlabels and activity labels
##
## using the Cbind function ADD "Subject ID" and "Activity ID" COLUMNS to Testdata and Traindata
##
## 
## combine the training and test data sets
##
## merge activity levels
##
## Created "1st Tidy Data by "extracting mean and standard deviation for features 
##

## Examine Tidy Data 1 using head and str functions
##
## Created Tidy Data 2
##
## Examine Tidy Data 2 using head and str functions
